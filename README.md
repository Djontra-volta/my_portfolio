## **[Exploratory Data Anaylsis (EDA) on King County Housing Data]** 
[Exploratory Data Anaylsis (EDA) on King County Housing Data]: https://github.com/vlatko-v/ds-king_county_housing-EDA

In this EDA project, I examined housing data from King County (WA, USA) in order to gain insights on the local housing market for a fictitious client. The goal of the project was to provide him with at least three recommendations based on his requirements. 

Given that the client was looking for housing units in specific neighbourhood types, a large part of the process involved examining geographical features to recommend suitable areas and house types.

In a first such project, I learned how to meaningfully think about the business goal at hand, especially with respect to distinguishing between relevant and less relevant data to gain the most important insights.

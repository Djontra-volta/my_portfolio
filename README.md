# Project Portfolio

Welcome to my page!

I am Vlatko Vilović, a social and environmental scientist passionate about exploring the world between technology, data science, and sustainability. 

I believe that the power of machine learning can be harnessed to address global challenges such as climate change, overconsumption, and resource inequality. By applying data-driven technologies, I aim to strengthen the positive interactions between society and the environment.

I hope my portfolio not only intrigues those who share my interests but also resonates with anyone curious about the potential of technology to create a more sustainable future.

## **[Exploratory Data Anaylsis (EDA) on King County Housing Data]** 
[Exploratory Data Anaylsis (EDA) on King County Housing Data]: https://github.com/vlatko-v/ds-king_county_housing-EDA

In this EDA project, I examined housing data from King County (WA, USA) in order to explore the characteristics of the local housing market for a fictitious client. The goal of the project was to provide him with at least three recommendations based on his requirements. 

Given that the client was looking for housing units in specific neighbourhood types, a large part of the process involved examining geographical features to recommend suitable areas and house types.

In a first such project, I learned how to meaningfully think about the business goal at hand, especially with respect to distinguishing between more and less relevant data to gain the most important insights.

## **[Conser-Vision: Classifying Images of Wildlife Species via CNN]**
[Conser-Vision: Classifying Images of Wildlife Species via CNN]: https://github.com/vlatko-v/drivendata-Conser-vision-Image-Classification

Camera traps are a tool used by conservationists to study and monitor a wide range of ecologies while limiting human interference. However, they also generate a vast amount of data that quickly exceeds the capacity of humans to sift through.

Using real-life images from the Taï National Park in Côte d'Ivoire, this project applies Transfer Learning and Image Augmentation techniques to create an image detection model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that is suitable for classifying 7 types of animal species.

## **[sweetspot - A Time-Series Forecasting Model for Reducing Food Waste]**
[sweetspot - A Time-Series Forecasting Model for Reducing Food Waste]: https://github.com/vlatko-v/sweet-spot-donut-sales-forecasting

Operating a food business comes with a unique set of challenges. Apart from health and safety standards or supply chain disruptions, the Food & Beverage (F&B) sector is struggling with perishability and waste, with roughly one-third of food being discarded every year.

In light of this challenge, this project aims to ameliorate the issue of food waste by developing a planning tool - called sweetspot - for more precise sales forecasting of a German donut manufacturer. By applying machine learning, this project can support accurate sales planning and better inventory management through the use of a wide variety of input information.

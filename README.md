# Data Science Project Portfolio

Welcome to my page!

I am Vlatko Vilović, a social and environmental scientist passionate about exploring the world between data science, sustainability and society.

I believe that the power of machine learning and data-driven technologies can be harnessed to address global challenges such as climate change, overconsumption, and resource inequality.

My portfolio will hopefully intrigue not only those who share my interests but also resonate with anyone curious about the potential of machine learning technologies to create a more sustainable future.

Have questions? Feel free to reach out!<br /><br />

## <ins>[sweetspot - A Time-Series Forecasting Model for Reducing Food Waste](https://github.com/vlatko-v/sweet-spot-donut-sales-forecasting)

Operating a food business comes with a unique set of challenges. Apart from health and safety standards or supply chain disruptions, the Food & Beverage (F&B) sector is struggling with perishability and waste, with roughly one-third of food being discarded every year.

In light of this challenge, this project aims to ameliorate the issue of food waste by developing a planning tool - called sweetspot - for more precise sales forecasting of a German donut manufacturer. By applying machine learning, this project can support accurate sales planning and better inventory management through the use of a wide variety of input information.

## <ins>[Conser-Vision: Classifying Images of Wildlife Species via CNN](https://github.com/vlatko-v/drivendata-Conser-vision-Image-Classification)

Camera traps are a tool used by conservationists to study and monitor a wide range of ecologies while limiting human interference. However, they also generate a vast amount of data that quickly exceeds the capacity of humans to sift through.

Using real-life images from the Taï National Park in Côte d'Ivoire, this project applies Transfer Learning and Image Augmentation techniques to create an image detection model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that is suitable for classifying 7 types of animal species.

## <ins>[Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): King County Housing Data](https://github.com/vlatko-v/ds-king_county_housing-EDA)

In this EDA project, I examined housing data from King County (WA, USA) in order to explore the characteristics of the local housing market for a fictitious client. The goal of the project was to provide him with at least three recommendations based on his requirements. 

Given that the client was looking for housing units in specific neighbourhood types, a large part of the process involved examining geographical features to recommend suitable areas and houses.

In a first such project, I learned how to meaningfully think about the business goal at hand, especially with respect to distinguishing between more and less relevant data to gain the most important insights.

## **[Exploratory Data Anaylsis (EDA) on King County Housing Data]** 
[Exploratory Data Anaylsis (EDA) on King County Housing Data]: https://github.com/vlatko-v/ds-king_county_housing-EDA

In this EDA project, I examined housing data from King County (WA, USA) in order to explore the characteristics of the local housing market for a fictitious client. The goal of the project was to provide him with at least three recommendations based on his requirements. 

Given that the client was looking for housing units in specific neighbourhood types, a large part of the process involved examining geographical features to recommend suitable areas and house types.

In a first such project, I learned how to meaningfully think about the business goal at hand, especially with respect to distinguishing between more and less relevant data to gain the most important insights.

## **[Conser-Vision: Classifying Images of Rainforest Species via CNN]**

Camera traps are a tool used by conservationists to study and monitor a wide range of ecologies while limiting human interference. However, they also generate a vast amount of data that quickly exceeds the capacity of humans to sift through.

Using real-life images from the Taï National Park in Côte d'Ivoire, this project applies Transfer Learning and Image Augmentation techniques to create an image detection model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that is suitable for classifying 7 types of animal species.
